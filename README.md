# tabviewer

This is a small python project I wrote to store and display tabs that I make.

Legend: (/) Slide Up  (\) Slide Down  (h) Hammer On  (p) Pull Off  (b) Bend (r) Release (v) Vibrato
Commands:
help - shows this page
readme - shows the readme
list - lists all available tabs

exit - exits the program
CTRL + C at any time will force-close the program.
Type the name of a tab file (without the extension) to open it. Capitalization is irrelevant.
